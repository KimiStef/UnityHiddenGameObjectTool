# HiddenGameObjectTool
Simple tool for unity to quickly check if there are the hidden gameobjects in the scene. 

Sometimes unity bugs out and makes these hidden gameObjects which you can't delete, remove or view.


How to use:
- Download the script or copy it. Then if the script is properly attached to your project you can find 'Hidden GameObject Tools' on the 'Tools'-tab and if you click it opens a new window.
- Click the "Refresh" to see if there are hidden objects. Or click 'Test' which creates a new hidden empty gameobject.
Three options to choose from: 'Select', 'Reveal' and 'Delete'
  - 'Select' the gameobject and show it on the 'inspector'-tab.
  - 'Reveal' the gameobject on 'Hierachy'-tab.
  - 'Delete' the gameobject.


* I haven't tested all the unity versions, but it works atleast from 2020.3.19f1 and later *
